 Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot
 to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied
 to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic
 of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, 
 or learn from past experience.
